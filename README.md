## Description
Expense Tracker is a web application that helps users track their expenses by categorizing them and providing visual breakdowns using charts. The application leverages React for the frontend and a JSON server for simulating a backend.

## Features
- Add, edit, and delete transactions
- Categorize expenses
- Visualize expense breakdown by category using pie charts
- Dynamic color generation for chart categories

## Technologies Used
- React
- Redux
- Chart.js
- React-Chartjs-2
- Chroma-js
- JSON Server

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/expense-tracker.git
   cd expense-tracker
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install and start JSON Server:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g json-server
   json-server --watch db.json --port 5000
   ```

4. **Start the React application:**
   ```bash
   npm start

## Usage

### Adding Transactions
Navigate to the transaction form and input the details of your expense or income. Select the appropriate category and submit the form to add the transaction.

### Viewing Expense Breakdown
Navigate to the "Expense Breakdown" section to view a pie chart that shows the distribution of your expenses across different categories.

## Example db.json
Here is an example `db.json` file for the JSON server:

```json
{
  "transactions": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "type": "expense",
      "category": "Food",
      "amount": 50,
      "description": "Groceries"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "type": "expense",
      "category": "Transport",
      "amount": 20,
      "description": "Bus fare"
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "type": "income",
      "category": "Salary",
      "amount": 1000,
      "description": "Monthly salary"
    }
  ]
}
